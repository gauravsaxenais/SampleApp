    "content1": "We trace our beginnings back to the early 1960’s, when our founder, Mr. Tony Falbo, started out manufacturing apartment intercom and related systems in Toronto. His company, known as Mirtone, quickly expanded to include fire alarm systems, and grew to become the 2nd largest fire alarm manufacturer in Canada, before being purchased by Edwards. However, Tony was just getting started as an entrepreneur! He started Mircom in 1991.",
    "content2": "Today, Mircom stands as one of the fastest growing companies in the building solutions sector and the largest independent fire alarm manufacturer in North America. Our product line spans Fire Alarm and Emergency Audio, Communications, and Security and our brands include Mircom™ (our principal brand), Secutron™, and U.E.C.™ United Export Corporation. With a well-earned reputation for excellence, innovation and quality, we have consistently achieved double-digit annual growth.",
